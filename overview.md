# Project Overview

The goal of this project is design tests to validate that a classification model is robust to perturbation of demographic attributes, such as gender, ethnicity, etc. As an example, if a model performs differently for Bob vs. Alice, or for a Bill vs. Guillaume, those are indications that the model might be biased. 
 
So, the hypotheses we are testing are: 
  1. Intents are highly correlated with sensitive attributes.
  2. By flipping the sensitive attribute of an utterance, we can modify the prediction.
 
We have broken down the project into a series of Phases. We estimate that this will take you roughly until the start of the school year, but we can adjust if things are moving faster or slower. There is no pressure here, and sometimes research is unexpected. 
 
	• Phase 0 – Technical Setup 
	• Phase 1 – Lit review 
	• Phase 2 – Dataset search 
	• Phase 3 – Methods design 
	• Phase 4 – Testing 
	• Phase 5 – (optional) Integration 
	• Phase 6 – Presentation 
 
Depending on your technical level, it might be worth spending a good amount of time on the trainings and bootcamps. Not everything will make sense right away, but you will know where to go back if you get stuck later.
