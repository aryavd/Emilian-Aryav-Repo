The paper presents a collection of Amazon reviews from multiple languages, balanced across star ratings and containing categorical information such as review title, category of product, and star rating. It reports the findings of the use of a text classification BERT model on the reviews, suggesting the use of mean accuracy error instead of classification accuracy on the data. The dataset of reviews contains 200,000 reviews that are split into training, development, and test sets and are available on AWS Open Datasets. The reviews are recent, collected over a multitude of countries, of an adequate length, and only for verified purchases. Additionally, only products with at least 2 reviews were included, and no more than 20 reviews were taken per product or per reviewer. The language detection algorithm filtered out reviews not written in the target language, and another vocabulary filter took out reviews with words that didnâ€™t appear in at least 20 other reviews. We can certainly reuse the dataset explored in the paper. It is a comprehensive multilingual corpus and the largest such public benchmark dataset. The dataset is curated to aid in research projects such as our own and has proven compatible with text classification models.
